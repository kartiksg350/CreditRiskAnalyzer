# CreditRiskAnalyzer

## Project Overview
This project analyzes loan application data to identify key factors that contribute to the risk of loan defaults. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), we explore the relationships between various financial metrics and loan default outcomes.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on two datasets:

Application Data: Contains information about clients at the time of loan application.
Previous Application Data: Contains historical loan data for the clients.

## Objectives
Identify patterns that indicate a higher risk of loan defaults.
Analyze the distribution of key variables and identify outliers.
Address data imbalance in the target variable.
Explore bivariate relationships to understand the interaction between variables.
Perform correlation analysis to identify strong predictors of loan default risk.

## Tools Used
Python for data processing and analysis.
Jupyter Notebook for interactive data exploration.
Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation.
Seaborn, Matplotlib for data visualization.

##Repository Structure
